# PythonCodeEditor
My team was working on a project to communicate using socket connections to send and recieve audio. We were using raspberry pi as it was to be installed at a remote place, but vscode-oss was not working in it due to some problem. So this was a quick project using python-tkinter to make a simple lightweight code editor.

## This editor supports 
- syntax highlighting for python
- terminal integration
- file creation
- opening and modifying previous files

### Shortcuts
- F5 for running currently open python code
- Control-s for saving files
- run terminal commands from within the app
